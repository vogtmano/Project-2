# Project 2 - Guess The Flag

Days 19-21 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 19: Asset catalogs, buttons, colors.

Day 20: Array shuffling, random number generation, @IBAction, and UIAlertController.

## Challenges

Day 21:

1. Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
2. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
